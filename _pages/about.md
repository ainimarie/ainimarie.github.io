Hello, I'm Aini. I started web-development in the early 2000 and then forgot about it for a couple of years ~~because it wasn't cool when I was a teenager~~ because I was chasing my dream of becoming a video game artist (spoiler: that didn't happen).

Right now I work as a fullstack software developer, mostly with React and Java. Accessibility and clean code are some important topics to me - I'm also interested in green coding. In my free time I knit/crochet, play video games, and dream about finishing personal projects.

My approach to everything is to try until you succeed and I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning.
